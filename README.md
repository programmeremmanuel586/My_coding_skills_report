# My_coding_skills_report

Initially created on December 22nd, 2018, I wanted to apply the skills I've gained in HTML and CSS, self taught, and create a report of coding languages I have experience with and have used.

Now that I'm studying Computer Science in college, I have been exposed to a lot more languages and work with complex programs to understand their usefulness in the real world and it's really cool that I have the tools to develop a mini application of my own.

From web design using HTML and CSS, to animation and game development using JavaScript, to working and creating day-to-day applications using Python, to learning about the very technologies that power and create the very software applciations we use every day using C and C++, to creating and managing databases and the information that get stored in them using SQL (wow, I know so much now), I am gaining the skills I need to create whatever technology I want, for the good of the people who need resoures and need help in their own lives.

I think its important to acknoledge the skills I have gained so I'm aware that a), I'm learning so much and b), I can apply what I learn and create the cool websites and games and applications I've always dreamed of creating. And its because I love to code, I love to learn, and I love to using my passion to create the technologies for the future.

I know this is just an HTML file with HTML and CSS code, but looking at this from the bigger picutre, its not easy to learn and understand this stuff. Its taking constant practice and learning to understand and grasp what I'm being exposed to. I know I can learn it, even if it takes me longer than others to grasp a concept.

I'm grateful and thankful for what I know and for what I will learn next and I will continue to work and to learn and to live up my future as a software engineer who creates tech for the betterment of the world we all live in.

Thanks for reading this, and continue to work on yourself and believe in yourself :D
